            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                A phrase is one or more words that form a meaningful grammatical unit within a clause. There are five main types of phrase in English, as below.
                <b>Noun Phrase</b> A noun phrase (NP) can be a single noun or a group of words built around a single noun, for example:
                <pre>
                    -Animals need water.
                    -Who ate the last sandwich?
                    -All passengers with tickets can board now.
                </pre>
                <p>
                <b>Verb Phrase</b>
                <pre>
                    A verb phrase (VP, also called a "verb group") consists of a main verb and its auxiliary verbs (including modals), for example:

                    -We have been working since 9am.
                    -I will be going to France next week.
                    -It may have been being repaired.
                </pre>
                </p>


                <p> 
                    <b>Adjective Phrase</b> An adjective phrase can be a single adjective or a group of words built around a single adjective
                    <pre>
                        -He has clever ideas.
                        -It was a very big meal.
                        -The students were really bored with the film.
                    </pre>
                </p>


                <p> 
                    <b>Adverb Phrase</b> An adverb phrase can be a single adverb or a group of words built around a single adverb,
                    <pre>
                        -Please do it now.
                        -He spoke very softly.
                        -They did it as fast as possible.
                    </pre>
                </p>


                <p> 
                    <b>Prepositional Phrase</b> A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition followed by its object (usually a noun phrase),
                    <pre>
                        -They were arguing about money.
                        -The window was behind a large brown sofa.
                        -They resumed after an unusually large meal.
                    </pre>
                </p>


                <p> 
                    <b>Examples of Phrases</b> 
                    <pre>
                        Phrases are a huge part of speaking and writing in English.  Here are a few you are probably familiar with, and their types.

                        -Once in a blue moon (prepositional phrase)
                        -Reading a book (present participle phrase)
                        -To be free (infinitive phrase)
                        -Totally delicious food (noun phrase)
                        -Running water (gerund phrase)
                        -As you can see, none of the groups of words above are full sentences, but they still work together—which is why we have phrases!
                    </pre>
                </p>



                <p> 
                    <b>Types of Phrases</b> The English language has an endless number of phrases. Different types of phrases serve different purposes and have different functions within sentences. All of the types here are both important and used all of the time in our everyday language. 
                    In fact, you probably use all of these types and just don’t know their names!
                    <pre>
                        a. Prepositional Phrase
                        A prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with a preposition and ends with a noun, pronoun, or clause 
                        (called the object of the preposition). For example,
                        "The dog is at the county fair."
                        In this sentence, “at the county fair” begins with a preposition (at) and ends with a noun (carnival), making it the prepositional phrase.

                        
                        
                        b. Participle Phrase
                        A participle phrase begins with a past or present participle, and is usually combined with an object or modifier. 
                        Present participles always end in ing, but past participles vary; regular verbs end in ed while irregular words are different. 
                        Participle phrases work like adjectives, describing something in the sentence:
                        
                        I saw the dog running towards the county fair  (present participle)
                        The dog ran towards the county fair. (past participle)
                        
                        In the first sentence, the participle phrase “running towards the county fair” works as an adjective. 
                        It combines the present participle “running” with “towards the county fair” to describe the dog. 
                        
                        In the second, the past participle “ran” does the same. Here are two more examples:
                        Eating popcorn, the dog was very happy.
                        
                        The dog’s belly was stuffed with popcorn.
                        The participle phrase underlined in the first sentence describes the dog, 
                        and the participle phrase in the second describes the dog’s belly.


                        


                        c. Noun Phrase
                        A noun phrase has a noun or pronoun as the main word, and acts like a noun in a sentence. Sometimes it includes a modifier, like an adjective, 
                        for example “big dog” and “brown fur.” Or, a noun phrase can be longer, like “the big dog with brown fur.” Here’s a full sentence:
                        The big dog with hot popcorn ran to the county fair.
                        You can tell that the underlined phrase acts as a noun because you could switch it with a single noun, like dog, and the sentence would still be correct. Here’s another example:
                        I bought a neon green ten-speed bicycle.
                        Again, let’s switch out the underlined phrase with a single noun to make sure the noun phrase works properly:
                        I bought a bicycle.





                        d. Infinitive Phrase
                        Quite simply, infinitive phrases start with an infinitive (to + simple form of a verb), and include modifiers or objects.
                        The dog likes to eat popcorn.



                        e. Gerund Phrase
                        A gerund phrase begins with a gerund (a word ending in ing), and includes modifiers or objects.
                        The dog ate steaming popcorn.




                        f. Appositive Phrase
                        An appositive phrase is a noun or noun phrase that gives another name to the noun next to it. 
                        It makes a sentence more descriptive:

                        The dog’s favorite food, popcorn
                        The dog’s favorite food, hot, salty, buttery popcorn




                        g. Absolute Phrase
                        An absolute phrase combines a noun, a participle, and sometimes other modifiers or objects that go with them. It is used to modify a whole clause or sentence.

                        This absolute phrase has a noun (popcorn) and a participle (popping):

                        Popcorn popping, the dog was ready for the movie.
                        “Popcorn popping” modifies the clause “the dog was ready for the movie.”
                    </pre>

        <b>What is a Sentence</b> 
        <pre>
            In simple terms, a sentence is a set of words that contain:

            a subject (what the sentence is about, the topic of the sentence), and
            a predicate (what is said about the subject)
        </pre>
        The above example sentence is very short. Of course, a sentence can be longer and more complicated, but basically there is always a subject and a predicate.
        <br><br>
        Note that the predicate always contains a verb. Sometimes, in fact, the predicate is only a verb:
    </p>


    <p> 
        <b></b> 
        <pre>
            So we can say that a sentence must contain at least a subject and verb.

            There is one apparent exception to this – the imperative. When someone gives a command (the imperative), they usually do not use a subject. They don't say the subject because it is obvious - the subject is YOU! 
            Look at these examples of the imperative, with and without a subject

            Note that a sentence expresses a complete thought. Here are some examples of complete and incomplete thoughts:
        </pre>
    </p>



    <p> 
        <b></b> 
        <pre>
            Note also that a sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a full stop (AmE period) or a question mark or an exclamation mark (AmE exclamation point). Look at these examples:

            -People need food.
            -How are you?
            -Look out!
        </pre>
    </p>



    <p> 
        <b></b> 
        <pre>
            There are four types of English sentence, classified by their purpose:

            -declarative sentence (statement)
            -interrogative sentence (question)
            -imperative sentence (command)
            -exclamative sentence (exclamation)
        </pre>
    </p>



    <p> 
        <b></b> 
        <pre>
            1. Declarative Sentence (statement)
            Declarative sentences make a statement. They tell us something. They give us information, and they normally end with a full-stop/period.
            
            The usual word order for the declarative sentence is:
            
            subject + verb...
        </pre>
    </p>







    <p> 
        <b></b> 
        <pre>
            2. Interrogative Sentence (question)
            Interrogative sentences ask a question. They ask us something. They want information, and they always end with a question mark.
            
            The usual word order for the interrogative sentence is:
            
            (wh-word +) auxiliary + subject + verb...
        </pre>
    </p>









    <p> 
        <b></b> 
        <pre>
            3. Imperative Sentence (command)
            Imperative sentences give a command. They tell us to do something, and they end with a full-stop/period (.) or exclamation mark/point (!).
            
            The usual word order for the imperative sentence is:
            
            base verb...
            Note that there is usually no subject—because the subject is understood, it is YOU.
        </pre>
    </p>








    <p> 
        <b></b> 
        <pre>
            4. Exclamative Sentence (exclamation)
            Exclamative sentences express strong emotion/surprise—an exclamation—and they always end with an exclamation mark/point (!).
            
            The usual word order for the exclamative sentence is:
            
            What (+ adjective) + noun + subject + verb
            How (+ adjective/adverb) + subject + verb
            Look at these examples:
            
            What a liar he is!
            What an exciting movie it was!
            How he lied!
            How exciting the movie was!
        </pre>
    </p>

<button class="collapsible">Sentence Structure</button>
    
    
<div class="contento">
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
        <b>we saw the minimum requirements for the formation of a sentence. Now we can look in more detail at the four types of sentence structure.</b>

        <p> 
            <b>Simple Sentence Structure</b> A simple sentence consists of one independent clause. (An independent clause contains a subject and verb and expresses a complete thought.
            <pre>
                -I like coffee.
                -Mary likes tea.
                -The earth goes round the sun.
                -Mary did not go to the party.
            </pre>
        </p>
    

        

        <p> 
            <b>Compound Sentence Structure</b> A compound sentence is two (or more) independent clauses joined by a conjunction or semicolon. Each of these clauses could form a sentence alone.
            <pre>
                I like coffee and Mary likes tea.
                Mary went to work but John went to the party.
                Our car broke down; we came last.
                There are seven coordinating conjunctions:

                and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so
            </pre>
        </p>

            <b>Complex Sentence Structure</b> A complex sentence consists of an independent clause plus a dependent clause. (A dependent clause starts with a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun, and contains a subject and verb, but does not express a complete thought.)

                We missed our plane because we were late.
                Our dog barks when she hears a noise.

<button class="collapsible">Linking, Intransitive and Transitive Verbs</button>
    
    
<div class="contento">
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
        <b></b>
        <pre>
            To understand sentence construction, it helps if you know a little about three types of verb:

            -linking verbs
            -intransitive verbs
            -transitive verbs

            All verbs have a subject (the person or thing that "does" the action). The real difference between linking, intransitive and transitive verbs is whether or not they have an object (the person or thing that "gets" the action).

            S = subject
            V = verb
            SC = subject complement
            DO = direct object
            IO = indirect object
        </pre>
    </p>



    
    <p> 
        <b>Linking Verbs</b>  Linking verbs have NO object.
        <br>
        Linking verbs link two parts of a sentence. They link the subject to a noun or adjective. 
        In this sense, linking verbs are like a mathematical equals sign (=).
        <pre>
            Linking verbs do not make sense if used alone: they need a "subject complement" to complete their meaning.

                They are (???)
                They are teachers
                I feel (???)
                I feel unwell
                In the above examples, teachers and unwell are subject complements.
            
            Linking verbs work in two different ways:
            
            the two parts of the sentence are the same thing (Mary is my mother)
            the first part has the quality described by the second part (Mary is English)
            The most obvious linking verb is the verb:
            
            be
            Other linking verbs include:
            
            appear, become, feel, get, grow, look, remain, seem, smell, sound, taste, turn
            Linking verbs cannot be passive.
            
            Look at these example sentences with linking verbs:
            
                Is that your car?
                I am feeling thirsty.
                John is my boyfriend.
                My father became an engineer.
                The milk will turn sour if you leave it.
                Her explanation did not appear plausible.
                Hillary remained under suspicion for the rest of her life.
                (Note that linking verbs are sometimes called "copula verbs".)
        </pre>
    </p>



    

    <p> 
        <b>Intransitive Verbs</b> Intransitive verbs have NO object. Their action is not transferred from the subject to something else.
        <pre>
            Many intransitive verbs can make sense if used alone:

            He fainted.
            She cried.
            Our car broke down.
            Of course, we often do follow intransitive verbs with other words telling us how, where or when—but NEVER with an object:

            He fainted after lunch.
            She coughed bitterly.
            Our car broke down in Bangkok.
            Intransitive verbs cannot be passive.

            Examples of intransitive verbs are:

            bark, boast, change, cough, die, go, live, run, sit, sleep, wave
            Look at these example sentences with intransitive verbs:

            They live in London.
            Tell your dog to sit now.
            Were the dogs barking?
            The news hasn't changed.
            He died after a long illness.
            When I saw him he was running.
            The president waved to the crowds.
        </pre>
    </p>



    

    <p> 
        <b>Transitive Verbs</b>  
        <pre>
            Transitive verbs have an object. Their action is TRANSferred from the subject to something else (the object).

            Transitive verbs can be active OR passive.
            
            Some transitive verbs have one object, some have two objects—as shown below.
        </pre>
    </p>







    
    <p> 
        <b>Monotransitive verbs</b>  
        <pre>
            Monotransitive verbs have ONE object: a direct object
            Examples of monotransitive verbs are:

            bomb, clean, break, destroy, eat, kill, like, put off, trigger, turn down, want
            Look at these example sentences with monotransitive verbs:

            Do you love me?
            The Allies bombed Dresden.
            Pick it up and throw it away.
            Tara doesn't want a new car.
            Bond killed the snake and ate it.
            Can fracking trigger earthquakes?
            Do you think they'll turn down my offer / turn my offer down?
                    </pre>
    </p>




    <p> 
        <b>Ditransitive verbs</b>  Ditransitive verbs have TWO objects: a direct object and an indirect object
        <pre>
            Examples of ditransitive verbs are:

            buy, give, grant, lend, make, pass, send, serve, show, teach, tell
            Look at these example sentences with ditransitive verbs:

            Make me an offer.
            Who teaches him French?
            The bank won't lend them any money.
            They will serve the guests lunch at 12:30pm.
            Kid refused to show the teacher her homework.
            Anthony bought his new girlfriend some roses on her birthday.
            The local council have granted us permission to open a shop.

<button class="collapsible">Direct Object</button>
    
    
<div class="contento">
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
        In the above sentence, the action or verb is "kicked". The subject (He) performed the action (kicked). And the object (the ball) received the action.
<br><br>
Strictly speaking, "the ball" is the direct object, and the direct object directly received the action of the verb. 
        <b></b>
        <pre>
            Notice that in all the above cases the subject is "doing" the action, and the direct object (D.O.) is receiving or undergoing the action.

            A direct object can be one word or several words. It can be:

            -noun (People eat rice.)
            -noun phrase (They bought a big red car.)
            -pronoun (I love you.)
            -phrase (Tara hates cleaning the house.)
            -clause (I love when he tells jokes.)
        </pre>
    </p>




    <p> 
        <b>We use Direct Object with transitive verbs only</b>  
        <pre>
            We DO NOT use direct objects with all verbs. Only a transitive verb can have a direct object. 
            With a transitive verb the action "transits" from the subject through the verb to the direct object (He kicked the ball). 
            The verb kick is a transitive verb because it can have a direct object. 
            But verbs like live, die, cough, sit do not pass any action to something else—they are intransitive and have NO object. 
            Look at these examples—each transitive verb on the left has a direct object, and each intransitive verb on the right has no object. 
        </pre>
    </p>





    <p> 
        <b>DO NOT use Direct Object with linking verbs</b>  
        <pre>
            Verbs like be, seem, smell, taste do not express action. Instead, they are like an equals sign (=) in mathematics. They are linking verbs. Look at these examples:

            Mr Brown is my teacher. (Mr Brown = my teacher)
            It seems strange. (It = strange)
            It became cold. (It = cold)
            There is no direct object in the above sentences because linking verbs do not perform any action. (In the above sentences, my teacher, strange and cold are "subject complements".)
        </pre>
    </p>







    <p> 
        <b>How to find the Direct Object</b>  
        <pre>
            To check whether a direct object (D.O.) exists in a sentence, and to identify it, ask "what?" or "whom?" about the verb.

            The teacher explained the rules.
            WHAT did the teacher explain? D.O. - the rules

            John loves Mary.
            WHOM does John love? D.O. - Mary

            He died in 1989.
            WHAT did he die? ???? (no D.O.)
            WHOM did he die? ???? (no D.O.)
        </pre>
    </p>





    <p> 
        <b>If Direct Object is a pronoun, the pronoun must be in objective case</b>  
        <pre>
            When the direct object is a pronoun, the pronoun MUST be in objective case. Look at these examples:

            Fred helped me.
            Does she like him?
            I told them.
        </pre>
    </p>





    <p> 
        <b>More example sentences with Direct Object</b>  
        <pre>
            The direct object can appear in positive sentences, negative sentences, question sentences and imperative sentences. Here are some examples showing the direct object in different types of sentence:

            James Bond changed his clothes and phoned Mother.

            The gardener cut the grass and trimmed the hedge.

            Hillary wrote two emails but then she deleted them.

            Do you want tea or coffee?

            Will you meet John?

            Why did you break her favourite toy?

            Can you make some fruit cakes and bring them to the party?

            When did you discover your talent for playing music?

            Shoot him!

            Don't kill him!

            Sit down and lower your voice.

            He has not finished his homework.

            They don't normally drink beer but they love the wine you served last night.

            I hate when they play loud music.

            They don't like being told what to do.
        </pre>
    </p>


    <p> 
        <b>Phrases and clauses can be Direct Objects</b>  
        <pre>
            As indicated above, a direct object doesn't have to be a single noun or pronoun. It can also be a complete noun phrase, a phrase or a clause. Look at these examples:

            We bought a brand new BMW sports car.
            Everybody loves eating chocolate.
            Johnny wants to go and play football.
            Please describe what you saw when you arrived.
            He thought that the show had started.

<button class="collapsible">Grammatical Category</button>
    
    
<div class="contento">
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
        The term "grammatical category" refers to specific properties of a word that can cause that word and/or a related word to change in form for grammatical reasons (ensuring agreement between words).
        <b></b>
        <pre>
            For example, the word "boy" is a noun. Nouns have a grammatical category called "number". The values of number are singular (one) and plural (two or more).

            The boy is playing.
            The boys are playing.
        </pre>
        In sentence 1, "boy" is in its basic form, giving its "number" the value of singular. There is one boy and the related auxiliary verb "to be" is in the singular form (is).

In sentence 2, the form of "boy" has changed to "boys", giving its "number" the value of plural. There is more than one boy and the related "to be" is in the plural form (are).
<br>
In the above example, the "number" of "boy" influences the form of boy, and also influences the form of a related word (be). "Number" is a "grammatical category".
<br>
English has over twenty grammatical categories. Below we list the most common ones for English learners and summarise their main features.
    </p>



    <p> 
        <b>Number</b>  
        <pre>
            Number is a property of nouns and pronouns, and indicates quantity. Number has two values:

            singular: indicates one only
            plural: indicates two or more
        </pre>
    </p>






    

    <p> 
        <b>Case</b>  
        <pre>
            Case is a property of pronouns and nouns, and expresses their relationship to the rest of the sentence. Case has three values (two of which do not apply to nouns):

            -subjective (pronouns only): when the word is the subject
            -objective (pronouns only): when the word is the object
            -possessive (pronouns and nouns): when the word indicates possession (ownership)
        </pre>
    </p>







    

    <p> 
        <b>Gender</b>  
        <pre>
            Natural gender is a property of pronouns, and differentiates the sexes. Natural gender has three values:

            masculine: indicates male
            feminine: indicates female
            neuter: indicates everything else
        </pre>
        Note that Old English had "grammatical gender" where words themselves had gender. 
        Remnants of this are found in "natural gender", which is based on the sex of people rather than the gender of words.
    </p>







    

    <p> 
        <b>Person</b>  
        <pre>
            Person is a property of pronouns, and differentiates participants in a conversation. Person has three values:

            first person: refers to the speaker
            second person: refers to the hearer
            third person: refers to all other people or things
        </pre>
    </p>






    <p> 
        <b>Tense</b>  
        <pre>
            Tense is a property of verbs, and most closely corresponds with location in time. Tense has two values:

            past: indicates before now
            present: indicates now (and sometimes before and after now)

            Note that "future tense" is not shown here because strictly-speaking it is not a tense but a structure to talk about the future (after now).
        </pre>
    </p>


    <p> 
        <b>Aspect</b>  
        <pre>
            Aspect is a property of verbs, and expresses our view of the time structure of an activity or state. Aspect has three values:

            simple: the time has no structure
            continuous: expresses ongoing action
            perfect: expresses completed action

        </pre>
    </p>



    <p> 
        <b>Mood</b>  
        <pre>
            Mood is a property of verbs, and relates to the speaker's feelings about the reality of what he is saying. Mood has three values:

            indicative: expresses simple statement of fact
            imperative: expresses command
            subjunctive: expresses something desired or imagined

        </pre>
    </p>




    <p> 
        <b>Voice</b>  
        <pre>
            Voice is a property of transitive verbs*, and expresses the relationship of the subject to the action. Voice has two values:

            active: the subject does the action
            passive: the subject receives the action

            *A transitive verb can take a direct object. (An intransitive verb does not take a direct object.)
        </pre>
    </p>



    <p> 
        <b>Degree</b>  
        <pre>
            Degree is a property of gradable adjectives and adverbs, and indicates amount. Degree has three values:

            positive: indicates a basic quality
            comparative: indicates a greater quality
            superlative: indicates the maximum quality
        </pre>
    </p>
