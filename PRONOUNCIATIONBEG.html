<button class="collapsible">Pronounciation</button>    
<div class="contento">
<p style="text-align:justify;">


    "Pronunciation" refers to the way in which we make the sound of words.

    To pronounce words, we push air from our lungs up through our throat and vocal chords, through our mouth, past our tongue and out between our teeth and lips. (Sometimes air also travels through our nose.)
    <br><br>
    To change the sound that we are making, we mainly use the muscles of our mouth, tongue and lips to control the shape of our mouth and the flow of air. If we can control the shape of our mouth and the flow of air correctly, then our pronunciation is clearer and other people understand us more easily.
    <br><br>
    Speakers of different languages tend to develop different muscles of the mouth for pronunciation. When we speak a foreign language, our muscles may not be well developed for that language, and we will find pronunciation more difficult. By practising the foreign language pronunciation, our muscles develop and pronunciation improves.
    <br><br>
    As well as creating correct vowel and consonant sounds using the muscles of our mouth, tongue and lips, there are other important aspects of pronunciation, including:
    <br><br>




    <pre>
        word stress - emphasis on certain syllables in a word
        sentence stress - emphasis on certain words in a sentence
        linking - joining certain words together
        intonation - the rise and fall of our voice as we speak
    </pre>

<button class="collapsible">Human Speech System</button>    
<div class="contento">
<p style="text-align:justify;">

    The words we speak travel through air, carried by vibrations in the air. To create those air vibrations, we have an amazing speech system, which is much more than just our mouths.
    <br><br>
    
    <b>Airflow</b>For every word that we speak, we can track the flow of air. It comes IN through our mouth/nose; it goes down our windpipe to our lungs. And then, to pronounce the word, it comes back up though our windpipe, and OUT through our mouth—and sometimes our nose.
    <br><br>
    <pre>
        As the air comes up from our 
        (1) lungs, through our 
        (2) voice box, and out through our 
        (3) vocal tract—THAT is when we vibrate the air and change the "shape" of those vibrations to create different sounds, syllables and words.
    </pre>






    <b>1 Lungs</b> The lungs are two elastic sacs in the chest that draw in air (mainly to oxygenate the blood). To initiate speech, they push air back up through the windpipe towards the voice box.
    <br>
    <b>2 Voice Box</b> As air rises up from the lungs through the voice box in the neck, it may or may not be vibrated (so-called voiced and unvoiced sounds).
    <br>
    <b>3 Vocal Tract</b> To control and shape the air flow above the voice box, the air travels through and exits the vocal tract, which consists of:
    <br>
    <pre>
        he mouth (oral cavity)—tongue, teeth, lips
        the nose (nasal cavity)
        
        Using the vocal tract, we resonate the air and make two main types of speech sounds:

        vowels
        consonants
    </pre>




 
    <b>Speech Sounds</b> When we speak in English, we use about 44 different sounds. When we write in English, we use 26 letters (the alphabet A-Z). You notice that there are more sounds than letters, and so there are not enough letters to represent all the sounds. It's important to understand that when we talk about speech and pronunciation, we are talking about the sounds of the phonemic chart, NOT the letters of the alphabet.
    <br>
    <pre>
        Examples: 
        The lungs push air up for speech.
        In the voice box, air passing through can be voiced or unvoiced.
        In the vocal tract, unblocked air makes vowels and blocked air makes consonants.
        Vowels and consonants make syllables.
        Syllables make words.
        Words make sentences.
    </pre>





    <b>1 Vowels</b> A vowel is a speech sound that we make by NOT blocking air as it travels out through the mouth.
    <br>
    <b>2 Consonants</b> A consonant is a speech sound that we make by blocking air as it travels out through the mouth or nose. We block air by touching together two or more of the lips, tongue, teeth, top of mouth and back of throat.
    <br>
    <b>Words</b> A word is a meaningful unit of speech formed from one or more syllables. For example, I is a one-syllable word and octopus is a three-syllable word.
    <br>
    <b>vibrate</b> move fast and continuously backwards and forwards
    <br>
    <b>oxygenate</b> charge or enrich with oxygen

<button class="collapsible">Word Stress</button>    
<div class="contento">
<p style="text-align:justify;">

    Word stress is your magic key to understanding spoken English. Native speakers of English use word stress naturally. Word stress is so natural for them that they don't even know they use it. Non-native speakers who speak English to native speakers without using word stress, encounter two problems:

    <b></b>
    <pre>
        They find it difficult to understand native speakers, especially those speaking fast.
        The native speakers may find it difficult to understand them.
    </pre>  
 

    <b></b>
    <pre>
        This happens in ALL words with 2 or more syllables: TEACHer, JaPAN, CHINa, aBOVE, converSAtion, INteresting, imPORtant, deMAND, etCETera, etCETera, etCETera

        The syllables that are not stressed are weak or small or quiet. Fluent speakers of English listen for the STRESSED syllables, not the weak syllables. If you use word stress in your speech, you will instantly and automatically improve your pronunciation and your comprehension.
        
        Try to hear the stress in individual words each time you listen to English - on the radio, or in films for example. Your first step is to HEAR and recognise it. After that, you can USE it!
        
        There are two very important rules about word stress:

        One word, one stress. (One word cannot have two stresses. So if you hear two stresses, you have heard two words, not one word.)
        The stress is always on a vowel.
    </pre>


    Word stress is not used in all languages. Some languages, Japanese or French for example, pronounce each syllable with eq-ual em-pha-sis.
<br><br>
Other languages, English for example, use word stress and pro-NOUNCE DIF-fer-ent SYL-la-bles with more or less im-POR-tance.
    
<br><br>
Word stress is not an optional extra that you can add to the English language if you want. It is part of the language! Fluent English speakers use word stress to communicate rapidly and accurately, even in difficult conditions. If, for example, you do not hear a word clearly, you can still understand the word because of the position of the stress.
<br><br>
Think again about the two words photograph and photographer. Now imagine that you are speaking to somebody by telephone over a very bad line. You cannot hear clearly. In fact, you hear only the first two syllables of one of these words, photo... Which word is it, photograph or photographer?
    

<b>There are two very simple rules about word stress:</b>
    <pre>
        1) One word has only one stress. (One word cannot have two stresses. If you hear two stresses, you hear two words. Two stresses cannot be one word. It is true that there can be a "secondary" stress in some words. 
        But a secondary stress is much smaller than the main [primary] stress, and is only used in long words.)
        2) We can only stress vowels, not consonants.

        Here are some more, rather complicated, rules that can help you understand where to put the stress. 
        But do not rely on them too much, because there are many exceptions. 
        It is better to try to "feel" the music of the language and to add the stress naturally.

<button class="collapsible">Sentence Stress</button>    
<div class="contento">
<p style="text-align:justify;">

  Sentence stress is the music of spoken English. Like word stress, sentence stress can help you to understand spoken English, even rapid spoken English.
  <br><br>
  Sentence stress is what gives English its rhythm or "beat". You remember that word stress is accent on one syllable within a word. Sentence stress is accent on certain words within a sentence.
    
    <b>Most sentences have two basic types of word:</b>
    <pre>
      content words
      Content words are the key words of a sentence. They are the important words that carry the meaning or sense—the real content.
      
      structure words
      Structure words are not very important words. They are small, simple words that make the sentence correct grammatically. They give the sentence its correct form—its structure.
    </pre>
 
    If you remove the structure words from a sentence, you will probably still understand the sentence.
    <br><br>
    If you remove the content words from a sentence, you will not understand the sentence. The sentence has no sense or meaning.
    <br><br>
    This sentence is not complete. It is not a "grammatically correct" sentence. But you probably understand it. These 4 words communicate very well. Somebody wants you to sell their car for them because they have gone to France. 
    <br><br>
    The new words do not really add any more information. But they make the message more correct grammatically. We can add even more words to make one complete, grammatically correct sentence. But the information is basically the same:

    
    
    
    <b>Sentence Stress Rules</b> The basic rules of sentence stress are:
    <pre>
        content words are stressed
        structure words are unstressed
        the time between stressed words is always the same
    </pre>



    <b>The following tables can help you decide which words are content words and which words are structure words:</b> 
    <b>Content Words
    </b>
    <pre>
          words carrying the meaning	            example
          main verbs	                            SELL, GIVE, EMPLOY
          nouns	                                    CAR, MUSIC, MARY
          adjectives	                            RED, BIG, INTERESTING
          adverbs	                            QUICKLY, WHY, NEVER
          negative auxiliaries	                    DON'T, AREN'T, CAN'T
    </pre>



    <b>Structure words - unstressed</b>
    <pre>
      words for correct grammar	                  example
      pronouns	                                  he, we, they
      prepositions             	                  on, at, into
      articles	                                  a, an, the
      conjunctions	                          and, but, because
      auxiliary verbs	                          do, be, have, can, must
      
    </pre>



    <b>Exceptions</b>
    <pre>
      The rules above are for what is called "neutral" or normal stress. 
      But sometimes we can stress a word that would normally be only a structure word, for example to correct information.
      Look at the following dialogue:

      "They've been to Mongolia, haven't they?"
      "No, THEY haven't, but WE have."
      Note also that when "be" is used as a main verb, it is usually unstressed—even though as a main verb it is also a content word.
    </pre>
