            <p style="text-align:justify;">
            It's not easy to describe a noun. In simple terms, nouns are "things" (and verbs are "actions"). Like food. Food (n) is something you eat (v). Or happiness. Happiness (n) is something you want (v). Or human being. A human being (n) is something you are (v).
            These pages explain more about the grammar of nouns and offer example sentences, quizzes and songs.
            <br><br>
            Nouns are an important part of speech in English, probably second only to verbs. It is difficult to say much without using a noun.
            There are several different types of English nouns. It is often useful to recognize what type a noun is because different types sometimes have different rules. This helps you to use them correctly.     
            <br><br><b>Common Nouns and Proper Nouns</b>
            <br>
            <b>Common Nouns: </b>Most nouns are common nouns. Common nouns refer to people, places and things in general like chair or dog. Any noun that is not a name is a common noun.
            <pre>
            Examples: teacher, car, music, danger, receipt
            Have you seen my dog?
            The books are on your desk.
            ...the pursuit of happiness.
            </pre>
            </p>
           
            <b>Proper Nouns</b> Names of people, places or organizations are proper nouns. Your name is a proper noun. London is a proper noun. United Nations is a proper noun.
            <pre>
               

            Rule: Proper nouns always start with a capital letter.

            Examples: Jane, Thailand, Sunday, James Bond, Einstein, Superman, Game of Thrones, Shakespeare

            Let me introduce you to Mary.
            The capital of Italy is Rome.
            He is the chairman of the British Broadcasting Corporation.
            I was born in November.
            Note: Adjectives that we make from proper nouns also
            </pre>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                <b>Concrete Nouns and Abstract Nouns </b>
                <br>
                <b>Concrete Nouns </b>Concrete nouns are physical things that you can touch.
                <br>
                <pre>
                Examples: man, rice, head, car, furniture, mobile phone

                How many stars are there in the universe?
                Have you met James Bond?
                Pour the water down the drain.
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Abstract Nouns</b>Abstract nouns are the opposite of concrete nouns. They are things that you cannot touch. Abstract nouns are ideas, concepts and feelings.
                <pre>
                    Examples: happiness, courage, danger, truth

                    He has great strength.
                    Who killed President Kennedy is a real mystery.
                    Sometimes it takes courage to tell the truth.
                    Their lives were full of sadness.
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Countable Nouns</b>(also called count nouns)

                You can count countable nouns. Countable nouns have singular and plural forms.
                <pre>
                    Examples:  ball, boy, cat, person

                    I have only five dollars.
                    The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago.
                    There are lots of people but we don't have a car.
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Uncountable Nouns</b>(also called mass nouns)

                You cannot count uncountable nouns. You need to use "measure words" to quantify them.
                <pre>
                    Rule: We never use uncountable nouns with the indefinite article (a/an). Uncountable nouns are always singular.

                    Examples: water, happiness, cheese

                    Have you got some money?
                    Air-conditioners use a lot of electricity.
                    Do you have any work for me to do?
                    Many Asians eat rice.
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Collective Nouns</b>A collective noun denotes a group of individuals.
                <pre>
                    Examples: class (group of students), pride (group of lions), crew (group of sailors)

                    Rule: Collective nouns can be treated as singular or plural. More about this at rules of subject-verb agreement with collective nouns.

                    His family live in different countries.
                    An average family consists of four people.
                    The new company is the result of a merger.
                    The board of directors will meet tomorrow.
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Compound Nouns</b>A compound noun is a noun that is made with two or more words. Most compound nouns are [noun + noun] or [adjective + noun]. Each compound noun acts as a single unit and can be modified by adjectives and other nouns.
                <pre>
                    Compound nouns have three different forms:

                        open or spaced - space between words (bus stop)
                        hyphenated - hyphen between words (mother-in-law)
                        closed or solid - no space or hyphen between words (football)
                    
                    Examples: cat food, blackboard, breakfast, full moon, washing machine, software

                        Can we use the swimming pool?
                        They stop work at sunset.
                        Don't forget that check-out is at 12 noon.
                </pre>

        <div class="contento">
            <p style="text-align:justify;">

                In this section we look at the grammar of verbs‚Äîtheir structure and form‚Äîand how we use them in spoken and written English.


                <p>
                    <b>Helping Verbs</b> 
                    <pre>
                        Imagine that a stranger walks into your room and says:

                        I can.
                        People must.
                        The Earth will.
                    </pre>
                    Do you understand anything? Has this person communicated anything to you? Probably not! That's because these verbs are helping verbs and have no meaning on their own. They are necessary for the grammatical structure of the sentence, but they do not tell us very much alone. We usually use helping verbs with main verbs. They "help" the main verb. (The sentences in the above examples are therefore incomplete. They need at least a main verb to complete them.) There are only about 15 helping verbs.
                </p>



                <p>
                    <b>Main Verbs</b> 
                    <pre>
                        Now imagine that the same stranger walks into your room and says:

                        I teach.
                        People eat.
                        The Earth rotates.
                    </pre>
                    Do you understand something? Has this person communicated something to you? Probably yes! Not a lot, but something. That's because these verbs are main verbs and have meaning on their own. They tell us something. Of course, there are thousands of main verbs.
                </p>



                



                <p>
                    <b>Primary helping verbs (3 verbs) </b>Helping verbs have no meaning on their own. They are necessary for the grammatical structure of a sentence, but they do not tell us very much alone. We usually use helping verbs with main verbs. They "help" the main verb (which has the real meaning). There are only about 15 helping verbs in English, and we divide them into two basic groups:
                    <br>
                    These are the verbs be, do, and have. Note that we can use these three verbs as helping verbs or as main verbs. On this page we talk about them as helping verbs. We use them in the following cases:
                    <pre>
                        be
                            to make continuous tenses (He is watching TV.)
                            to make the passive (Small fish are eaten by big fish.)
                        have
                            to make perfect tenses (I have finished my homework.)
                        do
                            to make negatives (I do not like you.)
                            to ask questions (Do you want some coffee?)
                            to show emphasis (I do want you to pass your exam.)
                            to stand for a main verb in some constructions (He speaks faster than she does.)
                    </pre>
                </p>



                <p>
                    <b>Modal helping verbs (10 verbs)</b>We use modal helping verbs to "modify" the meaning of the main verb in some way. A modal helping verb expresses necessity or possibility, and changes the main verb in that sense. These are the modal verbs:
                    <pre>
                            can, could
                            may, might
                            will, would,
                            shall, should
                            must
                            ought to
                        
                        Here are examples using modal verbs:

                            I can't speak Chinese.
                            John may arrive late.
                            Would you like a cup of coffee?
                            You should see a doctor.
                            I really must go now.
                    </pre>
                </p>



                



                <p>
                    <b>Transitive and intransitive verbs</b> A transitive verb takes a direct object: Somebody killed the President. An intransitive verb does not have a direct object: He died. Many verbs, like speak, can be transitive or intransitive. Look at these examples:
                    <pre>
                        transitive:

                            I saw an elephant.
                            We are watching TV.
                            He speaks English.
                        
                        intransitive:

                            He has arrived.
                            John goes to school.
                            She speaks fast.
                    </pre>
                </p>



                <p>
                    <b>Linking verbs</b> A linking verb does not have much meaning in itself. It "links" the subject to what is said about the subject. Usually, a linking verb shows equality (=) or a change to a different state or place (‚Üí). Linking verbs are always intransitive (but not all intransitive verbs are linking verbs).
                    <pre>
                        Mary is a teacher. (mary = teacher)
                        Tara is beautiful. (tara = beautiful)
                        That sounds interesting. (that = interesting)
                        The sky became dark. (the sky ‚Üí dark)
                        The bread has gone bad. (bread ‚Üí bad)
                    </pre>
                </p>



                



                <p>
                    <b>Dynamic and stative verbs</b> Some verbs describe action. They are called "dynamic", and can be used with continuous tenses. Other verbs describe state (non-action, a situation). They are called "stative", and cannot normally be used with continuous tenses (though some of them can be used with continuous tenses with a change in meaning).
                    <pre>
                        dynamic verbs (examples):

                            hit, explode, fight, run, go
                            stative verbs (examples):

                        be
                            like, love, prefer, wish
                            impress, please, surprise
                            hear, see, sound
                            belong to, consist of, contain, include, need
                            appear, resemble, seem
                    </pre>
                </p>



                <p>
                    <b>Regular and irregular verbs</b> This is more a question of vocabulary than of grammar. The only real difference between regular and irregular verbs is that they have different endings for their past tense and past participle forms. For regular verbs, the past tense ending and past participle ending is always the same: -ed. For irregular verbs, the past tense ending and the past participle ending is variable, so it is necessary to learn them by heart.

        These pages look at the English tense system and help you understand what tense is, why it's important and how we use it.
        <br><br>
        The concept of tense in English is a method that we use to refer to time - past, present and future. Many languages use tense to talk about time. Other languages have no concept of tense at all, but of course they can still talk about time, using different methods.
        <br><br>
        <p>So, we talk about time in English with tense. But, and this is a very big but:

            we can also talk about time without using tense (for example, going to is a special construction to talk about the future, it is not a tense)
            one tense does not always talk about one time (for example, we can use the present tense, or even the past tense, to talk about the future - see tense and time for more about this)
        </p>


    <p>
        <b>We cannot talk of tenses without considering two components of many English tenses: time and aspect. In simple terms...</b>
        <pre>
            Time expresses:

                past - before now
                present - now, or any time that includes now
                future - after now
                
            Aspect can be:

                progressive - uncompleted action
                perfective - completed action or state
        </pre>
        (Some say that simple tenses have "simple aspect", but strictly speaking simple tenses are simply unmarked for aspect.)

The progressive aspect produces progressive or "continuous" tenses: past continuous, present continuous, future continuous.

The perfective aspect produces perfect tenses: past perfect, present perfect, future perfect.

And the two aspects can be combined to produce perfect continuous tenses: past perfect continuous, present perfect continuous, future perfect continuous.

The above is a summary of the concept of tense in English. There are other factors, including voice and mood, that allow us to create more than the twelve tenses referred to on this page. We deal with those under the English tense system and tenses.
    </p>








        
    <p>
        <b>English Tense System</b> In some languages, verb tenses are not very important or do not even exist. In English, the concept of tense is very important.

        On these pages we look at how to avoid confusing tense with time, and the structure of the 12 basic tenses, with examples using a regular verb, an irregular verb and the verb "be".
        <pre>
            Don't confuse the name of a tense with time!

            It is important not to confuse the name of a verb tense with the way we use it to talk about time.

            For example, a present tense does not always refer to present time:

            I hope it rains tomorrow.
            "rains" is present simple, but it refers here to future time (tomorrow)
            Or a past tense does not always refer to past time:

            If I had some money now, I could buy it.
            "had" is past simple but it refers here to present time (now)
        </pre>
    </p>









        
    <p>
        <b>Basic Tenses</b> 12 tenses in active voice + 12 in passive = 24

        For past and present, there are 2 non-complex tenses + 6 complex tenses (using auxiliary or helping verbs).
        
        To these, we can add 4 "modal tenses" for the future (using the modal auxiliary verbs will/shall).
        
        This makes a total of 12 tenses in the active voice.
        
        Another 12 tenses are available in the passive voice.
        <pre>
            The usual structure of basic tenses with regular verbs is:

        +	positive	subject + auxiliary + main verb
        -	negative	subject + auxiliary + not + main verb
        ?	question	auxiliary + subject + main verb
        And here are the forms of the main verb that we use to construct the tenses:

        base V1	    past simple V2	    past participle V3	    present participle -ing
        work	    worked	            worked                  working
        </pre>
    </p>









        
    <p>
        <b>The usual structure of basic tenses with irregular verbs is essentially the same as for regular verbs:</b>
        <pre>
            +	positive	subject + auxiliary + main verb
            -	negative	subject + auxiliary + not + main verb
            ?	question	auxiliary + subject + main verb
            
            Here are the forms of the main verb that we use to construct the tenses:

            base V1	    ast simple V2	    past participle V3	    present participle -ing
            sing	    sang	            sung                    singing
        </pre>
    </p>









        
    <p>
        The links below are to lessons for each of the 12 basic English tenses*. For each tense we look at:
<br>
Structure: How do we make the tense?
Use: When and why do we use the tense?
        <b>Present Simple</b> The Present Simple tense is the most basic tense in English and uses the base form of the verb (except for the verb be). The only change from the base is the addition of s for third person singular.
        <pre>
            For positive sentences:

                There is no auxiliary verb.
                We conjugate the main verb by adding s to the third person singular.

            For negative and question sentences:

                The auxiliary verb (do) is conjugated in the Present Simple: do, does
                The main verb is invariable in base form: base
                For negative sentences, we insert not between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.
                For question sentences, we exchange the subject and the auxiliary verb.
        </pre>
    </p>









        
    <p>
        <b>Present Continuous</b> (also called Present Progressive)

        We often use the Present Continuous tense in English. It is very different from the Present Simple tense, both in structure and in use.
        <pre>
            The auxiliary verb (be) is conjugated in the Present Simple: am, are, is
            The main verb is invariable in present participle form: -ing
            For negative sentences we insert not between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.
            For question sentences, we exchange the subject and the auxiliary verb.


            How do we use the Present Continuous tense?
            We use the Present Continuous to talk about:

                action happening now
                action in the future


            Present Continuous for action happening now
                a) for action happening exactly now
                b) for action happening around now
            The action may not be happening exactly now, but it is happening just before and just after now, and it is not permanent or habitual.



            Look at these examples:

                Muriel is learning to drive.
                I am living with my sister until I find an apartment.


        </pre>
    </p>









        
    <p>
        <b>Present Perfect Tense</b> The Present Perfect tense is a rather important tense in English, but it gives speakers of some languages a difficult time. That is because it uses concepts or ideas that do not exist in those languages. In fact, the structure of the Present Perfect is very simple. The problems come with the use of the tense. In addition, there are some differences in usage between British and American English.
        <pre>
            The auxiliary verb (have) is conjugated in the Present Simple: have, has

        The main verb is invariable in past participle form: -ed (or irregular)

        For negative sentences we insert not between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.

        When we use the Present Perfect in speaking, we often contract the subject and auxiliary verb. We also sometimes do this in informal writing.

            You've told me that before.
            John's seen Harry Potter.
        
        In negative sentences, we may contract the auxiliary verb and "not":
        
            You haven't won the contest.
            She hasn't heard from him.
        </pre>
    </p>







    

        
    <p>
        <b>Present Perfect Continuous</b> The Present Perfect Continuous uses two auxiliary verbs together with a main verb.

        In this lesson we look at the structure and use of the Present Perfect Continuous tense, as well as the use of for and since, followed by a quiz to check your understanding.
        <pre>
            The first auxiliary (have) is conjugated in the Present Simple: have, has

            The second auxiliary (be) is invariable in past participle form: been
            
            The main verb is invariable in present participle form: -ing

            For negative sentences we insert not after the first auxiliary verb.

            For question sentences, we exchange the subject and first auxiliary verb.

            When we use the Present Perfect Continuous tense in speaking, we often contract the subject and the first auxiliary verb. We also sometimes do this in informal writing.

                I've been reading.
                Jenny's been helping us recently.
            
            In negative sentences, we may contract the first auxiliary verb and "not":

                I haven't been playing tennis.
                It hasn't been snowing.
        </pre>
    </p>






     
        
    <p>
        <b>Past Simple</b> The Past Simple tense is sometimes called the "preterite tense". We can use several tenses and forms to talk about the past, but the Past Simple tense is the one we use most often.

        In this lesson we look at the structure and use of the Past Simple tense, followed by a quiz to check your understanding.
        <pre>
            For positive sentences:

                There is no auxiliary verb.
                The main verb is conjugated in the Past Simple, invariable: -ed (or irregular)
            
            For negative and question sentences:

                The auxiliary is conjugated in the Past Simple, invariable: did
                The main verb is invariable in base form: base
                For negative sentences, we insert not between the auxiliary verb and main verb.
                For question sentences, we exchange the subject and the auxiliary verb.
        </pre>
    </p>






     
        
    <p>
        <b>Past Continuous</b> The Past Continuous tense is an important tense in English. We use it to say what we were in the middle of doing at a particular moment in the past.

        In this lesson we look at the structure and the use of the Past Continuous tense, 
        <pre>
            The auxiliary verb (be) is conjugated in the Past Simple: was, were

            The main verb is invariable in present participle form: -ing

            For negative sentences we insert not between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.

            For question sentences, we exchange the subject and the auxiliary verb.

            When we use the Past Continuous tense, our listener usually knows or understands what time we are talking about. Look at these examples:

            I was working at 10pm last night.
            They were not playing football at 9am this morning.
            What were you doing at 10pm last night?
            What were you doing when he arrived?
            She was cooking when I telephoned her.
            We were having dinner when it started to rain.
            Ram went home early because it was snowing.
        </pre>
    </p>






     
        
    <p>
        <b>Past Perfect</b> The Past Perfect tense is quite an easy tense to understand and to use. This tense talks about the "past in the past".

        In this lesson we look at the structure and use of the Past Perfect tense,
        <pre> 
            The auxiliary verb (have) is conjugated in the Past Simple: had

            The main verb is invariable in past participle form: -ed (or irregular)

            For negative sentences we insert not between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.

            For question sentences, we exchange the subject and the auxiliary verb.

            The 'd contraction is also used for the auxiliary verb would. For example, we'd can mean:
                We had, OR
                We would
                But usually the main verb is in a different form, for example:
                We had arrived (past participle)
                We would arrive (base)
                It is always clear from the context.
        </pre>
    </p>






     
        
    <p>
        <b>Past Perfect Continuous</b> The Past Perfect Continuous is another tense that expresses the "past in the past".

        In this lesson we look at the structure and use of the Past Perfect Continuous tense, Note that continuous tenses are also called progressive tenses. So the Past Perfect Continuous tense is sometimes called the Past Perfect Progressive tense.
        <pre>
            The first auxiliary verb (have) is conjugated in the Past Simple, invariable: had

            The second auxiliary verb (be) is invariable in past participle form: been
            
            The main verb is invariable in present participle form: -ing
            
            For negative sentences we insert not after the first auxiliary verb.
            
            For question sentences, we exchange the subject and the first auxiliary verb.

            Here are some more examples:

            John was very tired. He had been running.
            I could smell cigarettes. Somebody had been smoking.
            Suddenly, my car broke down. I was not surprised. It had not been running well for a long time.
            Had the pilot been drinking before the crash?
            You can sometimes think of the Past Perfect Continuous tense like the Present Perfect Continuous tense, but instead of the time being now the time is before.
        </pre>
    </p>






     
        
    <p>
        <b>Future Simple</b> The Future Simple tense is often called the "will tense" because we make the Future Simple with the modal auxiliary will.
        <pre>
            For negative sentences in the Future Simple tense, we insert not between the auxiliary verb and main verb. For question sentences, we exchange the subject and auxiliary verb.
            No Plan
            We use the Future Simple tense when there is no plan or decision to do something before we speak. We make the decision spontaneously at the time of speaking. Look at these examples:

            Hold on. I'll get a pen.
            We will see what we can do to help you.
            Maybe we'll stay in and watch television tonight.
            In these examples, we had no firm plan before speaking. The decision is made at the time of speaking.

            We often use the Future Simple tense with the verb to think before it:

            I think I'll go to the gym tomorrow.
            I think I will have a holiday next year.
            I don't think I'll buy that car.
            
            Prediction
            We often use the Future Simple tense to make a prediction about the future. Again, there is no firm plan. We are saying what we think will happen. Here are some examples:

            It will rain tomorrow.
            People won't go to Jupiter before the 22nd century.
            Who do you think will get the job?
            
            Be
            When the main verb is be, we can use the Future Simple tense even if we have a firm plan or decision before speaking. Examples:

            I'll be in London tomorrow.
            I'm going shopping. I won't be very long.
            Will you be at work tomorrow?
        </pre>
    </p>






     
        
    <p>
        <b>Future Continuous</b> The Future Continuous tense is often used in English as a way to talk about something happening at a given point in the future.
        <pre>
            For negative sentences in the Future Continuous tense, we insert not between will and be. For question sentences, we exchange the subject and will. 
            When we use the Future Continuous tense, our listener usually knows or understands what time we are talking about. Look at these examples:

            I will be playing tennis at 10am tomorrow.
            They won't be watching TV at 9pm tonight.
            What will you be doing at 10pm tonight?
            What will you be doing when I arrive?
            She will not be sleeping when you telephone her.
            We'll be having dinner when the film starts.
            Take your umbrella. It will be raining when you return.
        </pre>
    </p>






     
        
    <p>
        <b>Future Perfect</b> The Future Perfect tense is quite an easy tense to understand and use. The Future Perfect talks about the past in the future
        <pre>
            Look at some more examples:

            You can call me at work at 8am. I will have arrived at the office by 8.
            They will be tired when they arrive. They will not have slept for a long time.
            "Mary won't be at home when you arrive." / "Really? Where will she have gone?"
            You can sometimes think of the Future Perfect tense like the Present Perfect tense, but instead of your viewpoint being in the present, it is in the future:


        </pre>
    </p>






     
        
    <p>
        <b>Future Perfect Continuous</b> The Future Perfect Continuous tense looks at the past from the future.
        <pre>
            For negative sentences in the Future Perfect Continuous tense, we insert not between will and have. For question sentences, we exchange the subject and will.
            Look at these examples:

            He'll be tired when he gets here. He'll have been travelling all day.
            How long will Jo have been working when he retires?
            Next month I'll have been studying Chinese for two years.
            Will you have been working when I arrive?
            He won't have been studying long enough to qualify.
            Next week Jane is going to swim from England to France. By the time she gets to France she'll have been swimming non-stop for over thirteen hours.

      Pronouns are small words that take the place of a noun. Pronouns are words like: he, you, ours, themselves, some, each... We can use a pronoun instead of a noun. If we didn't have pronouns, we would have to repeat a whole lot of nouns. The following pages describe the grammar of pronouns.

      Pronouns are small words that take the place of a noun. We can use a pronoun instead of a noun. Pronouns are words like: he, you, ours, themselves, some, each... If we didn't have pronouns, we would have to repeat a lot of nouns. We would have to say things like:

Do you like the manager? I don't like the manager. The manager's not friendly.
With pronouns, we can say:

Do you like the manager? I don't like him. He's not friendly.

    <b>Easy Pronoun Rules</b> Here are 5 easy rules and tips to help you avoid mistakes with English pronouns. For more comprehensive rules please look under the appropriate pronoun on our pronoun grammar pages.
    <pre>
      1. A personal pronoun AGREES with the noun it replaces.

        Those cars are nice. They look expensive.
        John works hard. He will do well.
        That woman is my teacher. Do you know her?
        My friend and I are going shopping. Like to join us?
     
      2. DO NOT place an adjective before a personal pronoun. A subject personal pronoun can have an adjective AFTER the verb. (Exceptions are fixed phrases like poor me, lucky you.)

        NOT handsome him, red them
        NOT beautiful she, dangerous it, clever they
        She looked beautiful. It was dangerous. They are clever.
      
      3. Pronouns NEVER have an apostrophe ('). Do not add an apostrophe to possessive pronouns like hers, ours, theirs. (If you see an apostrophe, you are looking at a contraction.)

        The red bag is hers and the blue bag is ours. (NOT The red bag is her's and the blue bag is our's.)
        One must do it oneself. (NOT one's self)
        He's finished. (contraction = He is)
        It's started. (contraction = It has)
      
      4. My is NOT a pronoun. A pronoun replaces a noun. In "This is my bag" the word my describes bag (it is a possessive determiner). In "This bag is mine" the word mine replaces my bag (it is a real pronoun). The same is true of your, its, our, their - they are possessive determiners. His and her can be pronoun OR possessive determiner.

        Is this your car? (possessive determiner)
        Where are our keys? (possessive determiner)
        Jo sold his car. (possessive determiner)
        He took my hand in his. (possessive pronoun)
        She loved her work. (possessive determiner)
        I agreed to wait for her. (personal pronoun)
      
      5. DON'T put yourself first! It is good manners to put the other person before you. (This is not a question of grammar - just manners.)

        My wife and I are going swimming. (NOT I and my wife are going swimming)
        Ram, Tara and I went home. (NOT I, Ram and Tara went home)
        This is for you and me. (NOT This is for me and you)
        They took John and me to the beach. (NOT They took me and John to the beach)

  <b>Personal Pronouns</b> We use personal pronouns in place of the person or people that we are talking about. My name is Josef but when I am talking about myself I almost always use "I" or "me", not "Josef". When I am talking direct to you, I almost always use "you", not your name. When I am talking about another person, say John, I may start with "John" but then use "he" or "him". And so on.
  <pre>
    umber: singular (e.g: I) or plural (e.g: we)
    person: 1st person (e.g: I), 2nd person (e.g: you) or 3rd person (e.g: he)
    gender: male (e.g: he), female (e.g: she) or neuter (e.g: it)
    case: subject (e.g: we) or object (e.g: us)

    Examples (in each pair, the first sentence shows a subject pronoun, the second an object pronoun):

    I like coffee. / John helped me.
    Do you like coffee? / John loves you.
    He runs fast. / Did Ram beat him?
    She is clever. / Does Mary know her?
    It doesn't work. / Can the man fix it?
    We went home. / Anthony drove us.
    Do you need a table for three? / Did John and Mary beat you at doubles?
    They played doubles. / John and Mary beat them.
  </pre>
  When we are talking about a single thing, we almost always use it. However, there are a few exceptions. We may sometimes refer to an animal as he/him or she/her, especially if the animal is domesticated or a pet. Ships (and some other vessels or vehicles) as well as some countries are often treated as female and referred to as she/her. Here are some examples:
  <pre>
    This is our dog Rusty. He's an Alsatian.
    The Titanic was a great ship but she sank on her first voyage.
    My first car was a Mini and I treated her like my wife.
    Thailand has now opened her border with Cambodia.
    
    For a single person, sometimes we don't know whether to use he or she. There are several solutions to this:

    If a teacher needs help, he or she should see the principal.
    If a teacher needs help, he should see the principal.
    If a teacher needs help, they should see the principal.
    We often use it to introduce a remark:

    It is nice to have a holiday sometimes.
    It is important to dress well.
    It's difficult to find a job.
    Is it normal to see them together?
    It didn't take long to walk here.
    
    We also often use it to talk about the weather, temperature, time and distance:

    It's raining.
    It will probably be hot tomorrow.
    Is it nine o'clock yet?
    It's 50 kilometres from here to Cambridge.
  </pre>

</p>









<p>
  <b>Demonstrative Pronouns</b> A demonstrative pronoun represents a thing or things:
  <pre>
    Here are some examples with demonstrative pronouns, followed by an illustration:

    1) This tastes good.
    2) Have you seen this?
    3) These are bad times.
    4) Do you like these?
    
    1)That is beautiful.
    2)Look at that!
    3)Those were the days!
    4)Can you see those?
    
    1)This is heavier than that.
    2)These are bigger than those.
  </pre>
</p>









<p> 
  <b>Possessive Pronouns</b> We use possessive pronouns to refer to a specific person/people or thing/things (the "antecedent") belonging to a person/people (and sometimes belonging to an animal/animals or thing/things).
  <pre>
    We use possessive pronouns depending on:

    number: singular (e.g: mine) or plural (e.g: ours)
    person: 1st person (eg: mine), 2nd person (e.g: yours) or 3rd person (e.g: his)
    gender: male (his), female (hers)
    
    Below are the possessive pronouns, followed by some example sentences. Notice that each possessive pronoun can:

    be subject or object
    refer to a singular or plural antecedent

    Look at these pictures. Mine is the big one. (subject = My picture)

    I like your flowers. Do you like mine? (object = my flowers)

    I looked everywhere for your key. I found John's key but I couldn't find yours. (object = your key)
    My flowers are dying. Yours are lovely. (subject = Your flowers)

    All the essays were good but his was the best. (subject = his essay)
    John found his passport but Mary couldn't find hers. (object = her passport)
    John found his clothes but Mary couldn't find hers. (object = her clothes)

    Here is your car. Ours is over there, where we left it. (subject = Our car)
    Your photos are good. Ours are terrible. (subject = Our photos)

    Each couple's books are colour-coded. Yours are red. (subject = Your books)
    I don't like this family's garden but I like yours. (object = your garden)

    These aren't John and Mary's children. Theirs have black hair. (subject = Their children)
    John and Mary don't like your car. Do you like theirs? (object = their car)
  </pre>
</p>









<p>
  <b>Interrogative Pronouns</b> We use interrogative pronouns to ask questions. The interrogative pronoun represents the thing that we don't know (what we are asking the question about).

  There are four main interrogative pronouns: who, whom, what, which
  
  Notice that the possessive pronoun whose can also be an interrogative pronoun (an interrogative possessive pronoun).
  <pre>
    Note that we sometimes use the suffix "-ever" to make compounds from some of these pronouns (mainly whoever, whatever, whichever). When we add "-ever", we use it for emphasis, often to show confusion or surprise. Look at these examples:

    Whoever would want to do such a nasty thing?
    Whatever did he say to make her cry like that?
    They're all fantastic! Whichever will you choose?
  </pre>
</p>









<p>
  <b>Reflexive Pronouns</b> We use a reflexive pronoun when we want to refer back to the subject of the sentence or clause. Reflexive pronouns end in "-self" (singular) or "-selves" (plural).
  <pre>
    Notice that all the above reflexive pronouns can also act as intensive pronouns, but the function and usage are different. An intensive pronoun emphasizes its antecedent (the earlier word to which it refers). Two important points:

    We can remove an intensive pronoun and the sentence still makes sense. (If we remove a reflexive pronoun, the sentence no longer makes sense.)
    In most cases an intensive pronoun can go before of after the verb.
    Look at these example intensive pronouns:

    I made it myself.
    I myself made it.
    Have you yourself seen it?
    Have you seen it yourself?
    The President himself promised to stop the war.
    She spoke to me herself.
    She herself spoke to me.
    The exam itself wasn't difficult, but the exam room was horrible.
    Never mind. We'll do it ourselves.
    You yourselves asked us to do it.
    They recommend this book even though they themselves have never read it.
    They recommend this book even though they have never read it themselves.
  </pre>
</p>









<p>
  <b>Reciprocal Pronouns</b> We use reciprocal pronouns when each of two or more subjects is acting in the same way towards the other. For example, A is talking to B, and B is talking to A. So we say:
  <br><br>
  A and B are talking to each other.
  The action is "reciprocated". John talks to Mary and Mary talks to John. I give you a present and you give me a present. The dog bites the cat and the cat bites the dog.
  <pre>
    There are only two reciprocal pronouns, and they are both two words:

    1) each other
    2) one another
    When we use these reciprocal pronouns:

    there must be two or more people, things or groups involved (so we cannot use reciprocal pronouns with I, you [singular], he/she/it)
    they must be doing the same thing
    
    Look at these examples:

    John and Mary love each other.
    Peter and David hate each other.
    The ten prisoners were all blaming one another.
    Both teams played hard against each other.
    We gave each other gifts.
    Why don't you believe each other?
    They can't see each other.
    The gangsters were fighting one another.
    The boats were bumping against each other in the storm.
  </pre>
</p>









<p>
  <b>Indefinite Pronouns</b> An indefinite pronoun does not refer to any specific person, thing or amount. It is vague and "not definite".
  <br>
  all, another, any, anybody/anyone, anything, each, everybody/everyone, everything, few, many, nobody, none, one, several, some, somebody/someone
  <br>

  <pre>
    Most indefinite pronouns are either singular or plural. However, some of them can be singular in one context and plural in another. The most common indefinite pronouns are listed below, with examples, as singular, plural or singular/plural.

    Notice that a singular pronoun takes a singular verb AND that any personal pronoun should also agree (in number and gender). Look at these examples:

    Each of the players has a doctor.
    I met two girls. One has given me her phone number.
    Similarly, plural pronouns need plural agreement:

    Many have expressed their views.
  </pre>
  *Some people say that "none" should always take a singular verb, even when talking about countable nouns (e.g. five friends). They argue that "none" means "no one", and "one" is obviously singular. They say that "I invited five friends but none has come" is correct and "I invited five friends but none have come" is incorrect. Historically and grammatically there is little to support this view. "None" has been used for hundreds of years with both a singular and a plural verb, according to the context and the emphasis required.
</p>









<p>
  <b>Relative Pronouns</b> A relative pronoun is a pronoun that introduces a relative clause. It is called a "relative" pronoun because it "relates" to the word that its relative clause modifies. 

  <pre>
    Here is an example:

    The person who phoned me last night is my teacher.
    In the above example, "who":

    relates to "The person", which "who phoned me last night" modifies
    introduces the relative clause "who phoned me last night"
    There are five basic relative pronouns: who, whom, whose, which, that*

    Who (subject) and whom (object) are generally only for people. 
    Whose is for possession. Which is for things. 
    That can be used for things and people only in defining relative clauses 
    (clauses that are essential to the sentence and do not simply add extra information).

    Not all grammar sources count "that" as a relative pronoun.
    Some people claim that we should not use "that" for people but must use "who/whom". 
    There is no good reason for such a claim; there is a long history of "that" for people in defining relative clauses from Chaucer, 
    Shakespeare and the Authorized Version of The Bible to Fowler's and Churchill.
  </pre>
</p>

<button class="collapsible">Adverbs</button>
    
    
<div class="contento">
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      
      
      An adverb is a word that tells us more about a verb. It "qualifies" or "modifies" a verb (The man ran quickly). In the following examples, the adverb is in bold and the verb that it modifies is in italics.
      <br><br>
      John speaks loudly. (How does John speak?)<br>
      Afterwards she smoked a cigarette. (When did she smoke?)<br>
      Mary lives locally. (Where does Mary live?)<br>
      But adverbs can also modify adjectives (Tara is really beautiful), or even other adverbs (It works very well). Look at these examples:
      <br><br>
      <pre>
      Modify an adjective:
      - He is really handsome. (How handsome is he?)
      - That was extremely kind of you.
      Modify another adverb:
      - She drives incredibly slowly. (How slowly does she drive?)
      - He drives extremely fast.
      </pre>


<p>
    <b>Adverb Form</b> 
    <pre>
      We make many adverbs by adding -ly to an adjective, for example:

      quick (adjective) > quickly (adverb)
      careful (adjective) > carefully (adverb)
      beautiful (adjective) > beautifully (adverb)

      But not all words that end in -ly are adverbs. The following -ly words, for example, are all adjectives:
      friendly, lovely, lonely, neighbourly
      
      And some adverbs have no particular form. Look at these examples:
      well, fast, very, never, always, often, still
    </pre>
</p>






<p>
  <b>Kinds of Adverbs</b> 
  <pre>
    **Adverbs of Manner**
    Adverbs of Manner tell us the manner or way in which something happens. They answer the question "how?". Adverbs of Manner mainly modify verbs.

    -He speaks slowly. (How does he speak?)
    -They helped us cheerfully. (How did they help us?)
    -James Bond drives his cars fast. (How does James Bond drive his cars?)

    **Adverbs of Place**
    Adverbs of Place tell us the place where something happens. They answer the question "where?". Adverbs of Place mainly modify verbs.

    -Please sit here. (Where should I sit?)
    -They looked everywhere. (Where did they look?)
    -Two cars were parked outside. (Where were two cars parked?)


    **Adverbs of Time**
    Adverbs of Time tell us something about the time that something happens. Adverbs of Time mainly modify verbs.

    They can answer the question "when?":

    -He came yesterday. (When did he come?)
    -I want it now. (When do I want it?)
    -Or they can answer the question "how often?" (frequency):

    They deliver the newspaper daily. (How often do they deliver the newspaper?)
    We sometimes watch a movie. (How often do we watch a movie?)



    **Adverbs of Degree**
    Adverbs of Degree tell us the degree or extent to which something happens. They answer the question "how much?" or "to what degree?". Adverbs of Degree can modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.

    -She entirely agrees with him. (How much does she agree with him?)
    -Mary is very beautiful. (To what degree is Mary beautiful? How beautiful is Mary?)
    -He drove quite dangerously. (To what degree did he drive dangerously? How dangerously did he drive?)
  </pre>
</p>






<p>
  <b>Adverb Position</b> When an adverb modifies a verb, there are usually 3 possible positions within the sentence or clause:
  <pre>
    Adverbs with adjectives/adverbs
    When an adverb modifies an adjective or another adverb, it usually goes in front of the word that it modifies

    The position of an adverb often depends on the kind of adverb (manner, place, time, degree). 
    The following table gives you some guidelines for placement based on the kind of adverb.
  </pre>
</p>






<p>
  <b>Adverbs of Frequency</b> Adverbs of Frequency are adverbs of time that answer the question "How frequently?" or "How often?".
  They tell us how often something happens.
  <pre>
    Here are some examples:

    daily, weekly, yearly
    often, sometimes, rarely
  </pre>
  You probably see a difference between a) and b) above. With words like daily we know exactly how often. The words in a) describe definite frequency. On the other hand, words like often give us an idea about frequency but they don't tell us exactly. The words in b) describe indefinite frequency.
  We separate them into two groups because they normally go in different positions in the sentence.
  <pre>
    **Adverbs of Definite Frequency**
    Examples:

    hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
    every second, once a minute, twice a year
    once, twice, once or twice, three times
    
    Adverbs of definite frequency, like all adverbs of definite time, typically go in END position. Look at these examples:

    Most companies pay taxes yearly.
    The manager checks the toilets every hour.
    The directors meet weekly to review progress.
    
    Sometimes, usually for reasons of emphasis or style, some adverbs of definite frequency may go at the FRONT, 
    for example:

    Every day, more than five thousand people die on our roads.

    Adverbs of indefinite frequency mainly go in MID position in the sentence. They go before the main verb (except the main verb "to be"):

    We usually go shopping on Saturday.
    I have often done that.
    She is always late.
    Occasionally, sometimes, often, frequently and usually can also go at the beginning or end of a sentence:

    Sometimes they come and stay with us.
    I play tennis occasionally.
    Rarely and seldom can also go at the end of a sentence (often with "very"):

    We see them rarely.
    John eats meat very seldom.

  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determiners</b>
  <pre>
    Determiners are words such as the, my, this, some, twenty, each, any, which are used before nouns. Determiners include the following common types:

    Articles:a, an, the
    
    Demonstratives:this, that, these, those
    
    Possessives:my, your, his, her, etc.
    
    Quantifiers:(a) few, some, many, etc.
    
    Numbers:one, two, three, etc.
    
    Click on a topic to learn more about determiners.
    
    A/an and the
    Determiners (the, my, some, this)
    Determiners and types of noun
    Determiners: position and order
    Determiners: typical errors
    Determiners used as pronouns
    Every
    Possession (John‚Äôs car, a friend of mine)
    Such
    This, that, these, those
    Whole
  </pre>

  Generally speaking, there are four different types of determiner words. These articles, demonstratives, quantifiers, and possessives.
  <br><br>
Articles:
<br>
Articles are largely considered to be the most commonly used determiners. In the English language, there are three specific articles that can be used. These are ‚Äòa‚Äô, ‚Äòan‚Äô, and ‚Äòthe‚Äô. They are used to identify the noun which the speaker is referring to. 
<br>
If the noun begins with a vowel then ‚Äòa‚Äô is used, and if it begins with a consonant, then ‚Äòan‚Äô is used. For example:
<br>
A child
An amazing child
An aeroplane 
A big aeroplane
A dog 
An energetic dog
However, if the sentence was talking about a specific dog, then ‚Äòthe‚Äô would instead be used. For example:
<br>
The dog carried a stick
<br>
The aeroplane was very noisy 
<br><br>
<b>DEMONSTRATORS:</b>
Demonstrative pronouns are another kind of determiner, consisting of ‚Äòthis‚Äô, ‚Äòthat‚Äô, ‚Äòthese‚Äô, and ‚Äòthose‚Äô. that are used when the noun in question is there and can be pointed to. For example:
<br>
I like this cake <br>
These bananas are very ripe<br>
I wanted that slice of pizza<br>
I want those shoes
<br>
<br>
<b>QUANTIFIERS:</b>
Quantifying determiners specifically tell you how much, or what proportion of, the noun is being referred to. Examples of the are all, many, few, some:
<br>
He ate all the cake <br>
Many people like pizza<br>
All of the boys will be there<br>
Few children like brussel sprouts
<br>
As seen above, ‚Äòall‚Äô can also be used in conjunction with other determiners, such as ‚Äòthe‚Äô to specify what proportion of the noun in question is meant.
<br><br>
<b>POSSESSIVE DETERMINERS:</b>
Some nouns can belong to someone or something in particular. When this is the case, possessive pronouns  can be used to identify said ownership. These can include ‚Äòmy‚Äô, ‚Äòyour‚Äô, ‚Äòher‚Äô, ‚Äòhis‚Äô, ‚Äòour‚Äô, and ‚Äòtheir‚Äô. For example:
<br>
You are my best friend <br>
This is his car <br>
The dog wagged its tail<br>
Where is her phone?<br>
Today is our anniversary <br>
Their favourite band was playing <br>
The possessive pronoun is not affected by whether the noun is singular or plural. <br>
<br><br>
While they come naturally to most native English speakers, determiners can often be confusing to people learning the language. This is because there are so many different types of determiners.
<br><br>
By familiarising yourself with the definitions of determiners, as stated above, it can become much easier to identify which ones should be used in which sentences. If you are still struggling, try to compare the sentence that you are trying to say with the examples used above, and work out which one it is most similar to in structure.
