<button class="collapsible">English is not Phonetic</button>    
<div class="contento">
<p style="text-align:justify;">

    Always remember that English is not "phonetic". That means that we do not always say a word the same way that we spell it.
    <br><br>
    Some words can have the same spelling but different pronunciation,

    <b>Homophone</b> Homophones are words that have exactly the same sound (pronunciation) but different meanings and (usually) spelling.
    <br>
    For example, the following two words have the same sound, but different meanings and spelling:
    <pre>
        Usually homophones are in groups of two (our, hour), but occasionally they can be in groups of three (to, too, two) or even more. If we take our bear example, we can add another word to the group:

        bear (noun: large, heavy animal with thick fur)
        bear (verb: tolerate, endure)
        bare (adjective: naked, without clothes)
    </pre>


    In your own language you know many words that sound the same but do not mean the same. They are homophones (= "same sound"). In English, too, there are many homophones, and it's important to try to learn and understand them. We use homophones all the time, even in everyday speech. They are also a common source of humour in jokes, and frequently occur in riddles.
    <br>
    These pages explain homophones and give examples with audio, and also list many homophones by level and by type.
    
    
    <b>Alphabet Homophones</b>  
    <pre> 
        Pronouncing the English alphabet - with homophones and matching sounds, common uses, rhyming letters, rhyming words and common confusions

        Many learners find it difficult to say and/or remember the English alphabet, 
        either because the sounds used in English don't exist in their language or because the letters are pronounced differently in their language. 
        This table is designed to give five different kinds of help to such people.
    </pre>




    

    <b>Contraction Homophones</b> The following is a list of very common contractions with words that have a different spelling and meaning but exactly the same sound (homophones).
    <pre>
        you're / your

        it's / its

        we're / weir

        they're / their, there

        aren't / aunt

        we've / weave

        I'd / eyed

        he'd / heed

        we'd / weed

        I'll / isle

        you'll / yule

        he'll / heel, heal

        we'll / wheel

        here's / hears

        there's / theirs

        what's / watts

        who's / whose
    </pre>




    

    <b>Magic E Homophones</b> "Magic E" is an incredibly useful spelling rule that all native speakers learn when young but other learners of English are often unaware of. The basic version is that an E after a short vowel sound and a single consonant makes the vowel "say its name", i.e. take the pronunciation of that letter when you say the alphabet. This is how it works for the five letters that are vowels:
    <pre>
        a in hat changes to A in hate
        e in pet changes to E in Pete
        i in bit changes to I in bite
        o in hop changes to O in hope
        u in cut changes to U in cute
        Learning the homophones of words with a magic E in them can help you learn this pronunciation and spelling rule. 
        If you already know this rule, you can then use it to learn the words that are homophones, 
        e.g. using your knowledge of how to say "base" as a way of remembering the difference between bass guitar (which has the same pronunciation) and bass the fish (which is different).
    </pre>


    

    <b>Homophones by Vowel Sound</b>
    One of the easiest and most effective ways to remember the pronunciation of difficult words is to match them to 
    words that are spelled differently but are said the same way. The list below is organised by vowel sound to make it easy to find homophones, and to help teachers design lessons on difficult sounds. As the correct (phonemic) symbols for the vowel sounds might be unknown or not show up on your computer, 
    we have used our own system to show the vowel sounds and put them in order:
    <pre>
        Homophones by /æ/ as in cat
        Homophones by /ɑ:/ as in car
        Homophones by /aɪ/ as in my
        Homophones by /aʊ/ as in now
        Homophones by /e/ as in get
        Homophones by /eə/ as in hair
        Homophones by /eɪ/ as in day
        Homophones by /ɪ/ as in sit
        Homophones by /ɪə/ as in here
        Homophones by /i:/ as in feet
        Homophones by /ɒ/ as in off
        Homophones by /əʊ/ as in go
        Homophones by /ɔɪ/ as in joy
        Homophones by /ɔ:/ as in more
        Homophones by /ʌ/ as in cup
        Homophones by /ɜ:/ as in her
        Homophones by /u:/ as in food    
    </pre>




    

    <b>Past Simple/Participle Homophones</b> Studying homophones of past tense verb forms can be useful for:

    learning the pronunciation of the verbs (both the different pronunciations of –ed endings and irregular verbs)
    <br>
    being able to spot from the context whether a verb or another word is meant (eg, when listening to the sentences "I've been here before" and "I like beans on toast")
    <br>
    On the following pages you will find selected lists of regular and irregular verbs in past simple form and/or past participle form (V2 and/or V3) with corresponding homophones.
    <pre>
        based / baste
        
        bussed / bust
        
        chased / chaste
        
        guessed / guest
        
        leased / least
        
        missed / mist
        
        packed / pact
        
        passed / past
        
        peaked / peeked
        
        rapped / wrapped
        
        tacked / tact

<button class="collapsible">Phonemic Chart</button>    
<div class="contento">
<p style="text-align:justify;">

  This phonemic chart uses symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet. IPA symbols are useful for learning pronunciation. The symbols on this chart represent the 44 sounds used in British English speech (Received Pronunciation or RP, an educated accent associated with but not exclusive to south-east England).
  <br><br>
  This version of the phoemic chart is based on the familiar Adrian Underhill layout. Learners and teachers may want to print a copy of this phonemic chart to keep close at hand for reference. See full size (will print on A4 or US Letter)

          <b>The Charts</b> In 1869 the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev developed the first version of the now very familiar table of chemical elements. This showed all the elements that were known at that time and some that were discovered later. The elements are shown in order of increasing number of protons in the nucleus, starting with Hydrogen (H) which has one proton. The rows and columns are also arranged to highlight families of elements with similar chemical properties, including for example their propensity to interact, or not, with other elements.
          <br><br>
          These chemical properties recur as the similarities in electron and proton patterns recur, hence the adjective ‘periodic’. Thus the position of an element in the periodic table tells you a lot about how that element is made and how it behaves.
          <br><br>
          The same is true of the Sound Foundations chart. I don’t want to push the likeness too far, but there are some similarities which may help us to think about it in productive ways. For example, the rows and columns on the Sound Foundations chart tell you a lot about:
          <pre>
            Families of sounds with qualities in common (vowels, diphthongs, consonants, semi-vowels etc)
            
            How a sound is made (lip rounding, glides, fricatives, stops, nasals, liquids, voice, length etc)
            
            With which parts of the mouth and articulatory mechanism it is made (tongue, teeth, lips, voice, nasal etc)
            
            Where it is made (lips, teeth, palate, front, back, high, low, etc)
          </pre>

          

          <b></b>
          <pre>
            Monophthong vowels are arranged by mouth shape:

            left > right, lips wide > lips round
            top > bottom, jaw closed > jaw open
            The first two rows of consonants are paired:
            
            above, voiceless
            below, voiced

<button class="collapsible">Minimal Pairs</button>    
<div class="contento">
<p style="text-align:justify;">

  A minimal pair is two words that vary by only a single sound, usually meaning sounds that may confuse English learners, like the /f/ and /v/ in fan and van, or the /e/ and /ɪ/ in desk and disk.

          <b>Minimal Pair /ɪ/ and /i:/ sit seat</b> 
          <pre>
            As indicated by the /:/ part of its symbol, /i:/ is a longer sound than /ɪ/ and pronouncing it this way can help distinguish between the two in the pairs of words below. You will also notice, however, that /ɪ/ does not have a dot over it, making it a different mouth position from /i:/. 
            The sound /i:/ is said with the mouth much more spread, something like a broad smile. 
            This is why we say "cheese" rather than "chiz" (or "whizz") when we take photos.

          <b>Minimal Pair /e/ and /ɪ/ desk disk</b>
          <pre>
            Both sounds are short, with /ɪ/ being pronounced with a wider mouth, almost in a kind of smile. 
            This makes it much closer to the long sound /i:/ than it is to the short sound /e/.

            /e/ is a short single sound that is pronounced without your mouth moving, 
            whereas /eɪ/ is a diphthong (a merging of two sounds) and your mouth gets smaller as you are making the sound.

            /æ/ and /ʌ/ are the two closest vowel sounds in English and so it is very difficult to hear and pronounce the difference. 
            In fact, in some American accents there is no distinction between the two. 
            It is still worth language learners working on the difference between them, however, as there are many words that vary only by this sound.

          <pre>
            The sound of /əʊ/ (as in "O", "oh" and "owe") is a diphthong, meaning two vowel sounds blended into one. 
            You should be able to see the mouth moving from one position to the other while making the sound, with the mouth becoming smaller and rounder. 
            You can emphasize and control this by holding your hand in front of your mouth and bringing 
            the fingers in towards each other as you move from the first part of the sound to the last part.

            The sound of /ɔ:/ (as in "or" and "awe") is a single long sound. The mouth doesn't move while making this sound, 
            and you can pronounce it as long as you have breath.

          <pre>
            /ɒ/ is a short single sound made without the mouth moving. /əʊ/ is a diphthong 
            -- a longer sound made of two sounds 
            -- meaning that the mouth moves during production of the sound.

          <pre>
            If these two sounds are the same in your language, it may be difficult for you to pronounce them differently because:
            native speakers pronounce /æ/ in several different ways
            /æ/ is quite similar to /e/
            The clearest difference is that /e/ is spoken with a wider, more stretched mouth. 
            You can make this clear by seeing how your mouth gets wider and wider as you go from /æ/ to /e/ to /i:/.

            Both sounds are long single sounds but the mouth position is different, 
            with /ɑ:/ having a much wider open mouth position. 
            This is why your doctor asks you to say this sound to show him or her inside your mouth. 
            /ɜ:/ is much more like the sound people make when they are disgusted.

  When speaking on the telephone, it is sometimes useful to spell a word using English phonetic spelling. To spell "Club", for example, you would say: "C for Charlie, L for Lima, U for Uniform, B for Bravo."
  <br><br>
  It is very easy to learn English phonetic spelling. Start by spelling your name, then your company or address. Soon, you will know the whole alphabet. It also helps to remember that there are several groups of words that go together:

          <b></b>
          <pre>
            Dances: Foxtrot, Tango

            Shakespeare: Romeo & Juliett
            
            Men's first names: Charlie, Mike, Oscar, Victor

            Cities: Lima, Quebec
          </pre>

          

          <b></b>

            The English Phonetic Spelling Alphabet is widely used by police and military organizations, including NATO. 
            
            It is sometimes called the "NATO Phonetic Alphabet" but in fact it predates NATO by several decades. 
            
            It is also sometimes called, wrongly, the "International Phonetic Alphabet".

<button class="collapsible">Linking</button>    
<div class="contento">
<p style="text-align:justify;">

  When we say a sentence in English, we join or "link" words to each other. Because of this linking, the words in a sentence do not always sound the same as when we say them individually. Linking is very important in English. If you recognize and use linking, two things will happen:
  <br><br>

          <b></b>
          <pre>
            you will understand other people more easily
            other people will understand you more easily
            There are basically two main types of linking:

            consonant ⇔ vowel
            We link words ending with a consonant sound to words beginning with a vowel sound
            vowel ⇔ vowel
            We link words ending with a vowel sound to words beginning with a vowel sound
          </pre>

          

          <b>Linking Consonant to Vowel</b>
          <pre>
            When a word ends in a consonant sound, we often move the consonant sound to the beginning of the next word if it starts with a vowel sound.

            For example, in the phrase turn off...
            
            we write it like this:	turn off
            we say it like this:	tur-noff


            Remember that it's the sound that matters.

            In the next example sentence, have ends with...

            the letter e (which is a vowel)
            but the sound v (which is a consonant)
            So we link the ending consonant sound of have to the beginning vowel sound of the next word a.

            And in fact we have four consonant to vowel links in this sentence:

            We write it like this:	Can I have a bit of egg?
            We say it like this:	ca-ni-ha-va-bi-to-vegg?

            
          </pre>

    
          

          <b>Linking Vowel to Vowel</b>
          <pre>
            When one word ends with a vowel sound and the next word begins with a vowel sound, 
            we link the words with a sort of Y or W sound. 
            It depends on the shape of our mouth at the end of the first word.

            Lips wide
            o o
             |
             —
            When the first word ends in an a, e, i vowel sound [ eɪ / i: / aɪ ], our lips are wide. 
            Then we insert a Y sound at the beginning of the next word:
            
            we write	first
            word
            ends
            with	we say
            pay all	/eɪ/	payyall
            the end	/i:/	theyend
            lie on	/aɪ/	lieyon
            write	They all buy at the arcade.
            say	theyyall buyyat theyarcade
            Here are some more examples of word pairs that are linked with Y.
            
            lay out, may I, say it
            he ate, she is, we are
            high up, my arm, why ever
            Lips round
            o o
            |
            o
            When the first word ends in an o, u vowel sound [ əʊ / u: ], our lips are round. 
            Then we insert a W sound at the beginning of the next word:
            
            we write	first
            word
            ends
            with	we say
            go out	/əʊ/	gowout
            too often	/u:/	toowoften
            write	You all go out too often.
            say	youwall gowout toowoften
            Here are some more examples of word pairs that are linked with W.
            
            no other, show off, grow up
            you are, too often, throw it
